# Handheld Astrometry

Scope to point out what star it is pointed at using astrometry. 

- Needs: 
-- Some way to figure out orientation (Astrometry.net API Calls)
-- Some way to display relevant info on scope (Mirror to OLED?)
-- Some way to perform the processing on board or close by

- HUD Notes: 
-- Use OLED with collimating lens (i.e. plano convex with oled at focal length away) to make image appear at infinity 
-- Use glass at 45 degree to reflect into eyepiece

- Position/Attitude Tracking
-- AHRS to get rough orientation solution 
-- GPS to get reference lat lon
-- correct solution with actual observations 
-- Take observations with camera and Astrometry API
--- Can this be fed attitude estimates?
--- Use openCV to mask the stars?
