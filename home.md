        About Me
        </h2>
        <p>I am an Aerospace Engineering Sciences PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, working on decentralized multi-agent autonomy. My research focuses on observation task allocation and scheduling for satellite constellations. My previous education is in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics from the University of Minnesota, where I achieved a Bachelor's, in addition to a minor in Astrophysics.</p>

        Flying Experience
        </h2>
        <p>I have extensive experience flying both fixed wing and multi-rotor aircraft. Since I was 10, I have been flying fixed wing line-of-sight, from 2ft indoor aircraft, to 13ft outdoor gassers. For the last 5 years I have flown fixed wing and multirotor professionally as a test pilot for Sentera. I have several hundred hours on both types of platforms, and have experience with DJI's full enterprise series, in addition to a few other heavy lift industrial multi-rotors. I am also well proficient in first person view (FPV), as I raced 2.5" multirotor for about 2 years, and continue to fly FPV on fixed wing aircraft.</p>

        Design Experience
        </h2>
        <p>In addition to experience flying, I also have experience in designing aircraft as well as modifying commercial products (see new legs on picture to left). I have been building fixed wing aircraft almost as long as I have been flying them, both from foamboard and balsa. Professionally, I have done several modifications to commercial aircraft from sensor payloads to flight components. I am proficient in MavLink, with a heavy focus on ArduPilot platforms. I have also worked with several custom builds of PX4. From my work and projects, I have experience working with a wide range of CAD programs, with most proficiency in Creo (7) and Fusion 360.</p>
